# Starcraft Client for Twitter

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository and `cd starcraft-twitter/`

* `npm install` and `npm start`

* If you are feeling dangerous and would like to code by [TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) then after making changes, run `npm run tcr` on your branch.

* After making changes and committing, husky will run prettier and then make sure the tests pass!
